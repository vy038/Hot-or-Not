# Hot-or-Not
I made this as a joke in a way to learn how to use some AI features, like facial recognition, and was able to control a servo connected to an Arduino every time it detected my face. If my face was detected by the program, then it would send a serial signal, which would then be received by the Arduino, and then the servo would be moved accordingly.
